RakNet is a C# networking engine specifically designed for game development. It provides a reliable UDP-based protocol 
that offers many of the benefits of TCP, like message reliability and ordering, while maintaining the low latency of UDP. 
This balance makes RakNet especially suited for games, where network communication must be both efficient and consistent.
